- More interactive intro/conclusion
- “Hint” choice as part of multiple-choice prompt 
- Score system (different endings depending how well user does)
- MINI-GAME: Creates grid as chest visual instead of “compression location” multiple-choice question. Has various letters placed in grid mimicking chest location. User is prompted to type in the two correct letters corresponding to the correct hand placement during CPR.
- MINI-GAME: “Guess the number” instead of “compression rate - how many compressions per minute should user do during CPR?” multiple-choice question. Player is prompted to input correct number. “Too high” / “Too low” if wrong until player is correct.

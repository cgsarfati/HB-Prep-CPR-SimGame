Important questions:-	How to convert for loop in airway.py into while loop (so that everytime user gets question wrong, “try again” message appears and question is presented again. Will iterate to next question when user inputs correct response.)-	A way to combine the 3 question functions into one function without compromising clarity --- they repeat the same code, so it can be done for succinctness. However, for now, I branched it out to 3 different functions (airway_qs, breathing_qs, compression_qs) to organize the code better and to call each one in the repl functiono	Expand dictionary to e.g. airway_question: ____, ___, ___-	How to break out of repl loop once all 3 challenges have been completed (moves on to conclusion text)o	use score system??? -	Review and see if you can add the two mini-games to replace questions without changing the whole format of the code-	Find a way to not be able to pick an already-completed choice in main menu -	Find a way for user to click choices in main menu in correct order (correct = C-A-B); gets error message if wrong orderGeneral to-do-list:-	Clean up code format-wise -	Clean up code to have responses for all wrong types of user input
